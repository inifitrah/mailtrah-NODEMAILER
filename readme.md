This code is as simple as implementing the nodemailer library. as simple as configuring the transporter.

  const example = await transporter.sendMail({
    from: '"Maddison Foo Koch 👻" <maddison53@ethereal.email>', // sender address
    to: "bar@example.com, baz@example.com", // list of receivers
    subject: "Hello ✔", // Subject line
    text: "Hello world?", // plain text body
    html: "<b>Hello world?</b>", // html body
  });
